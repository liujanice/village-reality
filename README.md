# village-reality

Village Reality was my group's final project during our GWC Summer Immersion Program.We were all unfamiliar with virtual reality and this tool, but we managed to create this project in one week with some guidance from our TA's and A-Frame tutorial.

Summary:
We created a VR game using A-Frame to raise awareness of the lack of toilets in the world. We wanted to raise awareness of this prominent problem that 2.5 billion people in the world face but most take for granted. In this game, a user will learn more about the problem and the reason why many people do not have access to toilets, one of the reasons being cost. Users will be encouraged to get involved, either through volunteering or donations.

The problem: 
Many places in the world, especially rural areas, do not have access to clean, sanitary toilets. Unsanitary toilets can lead to illnesses, such as diarrhea.

Solution: 
Our project brings awareness to the lack of toilets as an issue that many people do not realize or even know about. We encourage people to get more involved by encouraging them to donate to the listed organizations that we know help fund the implementation of toilets in these rural areas. 

Technical Hurdles: 
We had trouble implementing our main activity in our game, which is building a toilet. At first, we had trouble figuring out how to add it to our game, but we overcame it by persevering until we were satisfied with the end result.

We used Google Cardboard to view our virtual reality space.
